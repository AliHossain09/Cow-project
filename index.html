        <h2>ABOUT COW</h2>
        <p>
            Cow is a domesticated animal. Cow is an important animal for household work. Cows are useful to us and a lot
            of work is done by them. As an animal, cow is a calm and harmless animal.

            Cow is a four legged animal. It is three to four cubits in height and five to six cubits in length. A cow
            has two eyes, two ears, two horns, a long head and a tail behind. The entire body of the cow is covered with
            short and dense hair. Cows come in different colors like red, black, white and are found all over the world.

            Cow is a herbivore. Grass, straw and leaves are the main food for cattle. Moreover, the rice fan eats dry
            grains.

            The benefits of cow in our life are infinite. Cow's milk is very tasty and nutritious. This milk is used to
            make various products like yogurt, chickpea butter, etc. which are very beneficial for health. We use
            bullocks or oxen to cultivate our land. Bullock carts are also used for transporting goods. Moreover, cow
            dung is used as a good fertilizer in agriculture.

            We do not care about cows despite their qualities. Looking at the benefits of cows, we all need to be kind
            to cows. We need to be encouraged to raise cows, then we can benefit financially in many ways.
